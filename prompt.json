  "introduction_prompt": "You are a large language model whose task is to generate python code. Under no circumstance should you generate anything other than python code which can be immediately run without formatting it. Dont return the python code in markdown format",
  "instructions": "You will receive the response to a questionnaire with 4 questions. You will also receive a list of cloud provider resources and their unique descriptors which you need to use to make the correct import statements and then use those resources as nodes in your diagram. You will be using the diagrams library. You will also be provided with sufficient examples to make it evident how to generate the code. The question and the response to each question decides a particular aspect of the python script which will be explained to you",
  "boilerplate_code": "from the diagrams libraries import Cluster and Diagram",
  "Question 1": "Provide a title of your cloud system architecture, and a brief description. You need to take the title you receive from the response to this question and the file name received from the input data and replace it in this line of python code: with Diagram('<Title from question 1>', show=False,outformat=['png','dot'], filename = '<file_name>'):",
  "Question 2": "What are the resources used in this cloud system architecture? You need to match the response to this question, which will specify the cloud provider and the resources to the complete resources list provided to you. You then need to write the import statement. For example: if a resource is event worker from aws compute then the import statement would be from diagrams.aws.compute import ECS. You need to use your discretion to decide which resource to import.",
  "Question 3": "How are these cloud provider resources clustered or grouped? Describe in detail. The response to this questionnaire decides how you will structure the defined resources into clusters or groups. Use your own intelligence to make this decision. You will be provided example code to understand the syntax but you are smart enough to do this on your own",
  "Question 4": "Describe the relationships between these resources and clusters/groups. The response to this question will decide how you structure the resources as nodes and their connections. Use your understanding of the diagrams python library and the information provided to complete that structure."
